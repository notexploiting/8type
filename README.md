# puretype

puretype is a minimalistic typing test website built on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

a public link will be released later with GitHub pages, but you can test this yourself:
1. download and extract the source code ZIP
2. run the index.html with a browser of your choice

things to work on
- [x] the JavaScript behind the tests
- [ ] test length selector
- [ ] more seemless way to add themes
- [ ] overall formatting and layout
